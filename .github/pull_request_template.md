I hereby confirm that I have:

- [ ] Checked that the functionality works as expected.
- [ ] Checked the mobile version.
- [ ] Scaled up (used longer names/texts) to ensure proper wrapping and layout.
- [ ] Verified that the component I modified works correctly everywhere it's used.
- [ ] Ensured there is no unnecessary data fetching.
- [ ] Confirmed that I am not creating something that already exists in the codebase.
- [ ] Cleaned up the code (removed `console.log`s and commented-out code).
- [ ] Double-checked merge conflicts (if any) and selected the correct version.
- [ ] Named this PR **without the CU ID** and similar to the **CU task name & branch name**.
- [ ] Added `[WIP]` to the PR name if I'm still working on it.
- [ ] Added two reviewers, one of whom is the task creator.
